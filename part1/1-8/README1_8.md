#### Exercise 1.8
[Link to Docker Hub project](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/nakkekakke/calculator)

How to run:

    docker pull nakkekakke/calculator
    docker run -it nakkekakke/calculator

When the program is running, enter two integer values you want to use in the calculation. After the two values are given, choose what sort of operation you want to use for those values. The program will put out the result. Ctrl+c exits the program. Using other than integer values will crash the application.
