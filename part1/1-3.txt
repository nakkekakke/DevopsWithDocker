First I tried running just this command:

docker run -it ubuntu:16.04 sh -c 'read website; sleep 3; curl http://$website;'

but it did not work, because curl was not installed.
So I ran this command to start the container:

docker run -it ubuntu:16.04


Now inside the container I ran these commands to install curl:

apt-get update
apt-get install curl


Then this would work and return the correct html code when typing in "helsinki.fi":

sh -c 'read website; sleep 3; curl http://$website;'
